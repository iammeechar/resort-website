#### {Web development application used to test out branching.}, {05/04/2021}
#### By **{Meechar}**
## Description
{This is a webpage used to perform tests on branching. I have created two different basic versions of the webpage testing out different aspects
of CSS and gitHub manipulation along the way.}
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Google chrome or any other browser 
{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? Do I need to install any dependencies? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this app depends on?}
## Known Bugs
{Background image setting and page navigation issues. Fix using different images and different css properties  }
## Technologies Used
{HTML and CSS. Used HTML to align text on some pages and in others used CSS}
